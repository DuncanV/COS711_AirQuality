# COS711_AirQuality

### Introduction
This program is a python project that will demonstrate the use of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) on the AirQo Ugandan Air Quality Forecast Challenge provided by Zindi.
The program uses Keras from Tensorflow in order to do both the CNN as well as the LSTM.
